# 🤖 Creating Your AutoPrep Team Developer Agent

## What Is This?

This repository contains everything you need to create a **reusable Lindy agent** that can manage and update your AutoPrep Team Dashboard. Instead of manually editing code, you'll be able to simply tell your agent what you want, and it will handle the rest!

---

## 📋 Quick Overview

**What the agent does**:
- Pulls latest code from GitHub
- Makes code changes (features, fixes, updates)
- Tests changes locally
- Commits and pushes to GitHub
- Vercel auto-deploys your changes

**Example commands**:
- "Add a dark mode toggle to the homepage"
- "Fix the calendar sync bug"
- "Add a new Lindy agent for email summaries"

**Need to revert changes**:
- Tell agent: "Revert the last commit in AutoPrep-Team"
- Or manually: `git revert HEAD && git push`
