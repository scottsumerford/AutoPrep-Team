# Database Connection Issue - NEEDS POOLED CONNECTION

## Current Problem

The Supabase connection string provided is a **DIRECT connection** (port 5432), but the Vercel Postgres SDK requires a **POOLED connection**.

**Error Message:**
```
VercelPostgresError - 'invalid_connection_string': This connection string is meant to be used with a direct connection. Make sure to use a pooled connection string or try `createClient()` instead.
```

## What We Need

From your Supabase dashboard, please get the **Transaction Pooler** connection string:

### How to Find It in Supabase:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on **"Project Settings"** (gear icon)
3. Click on **"Database"** in the left sidebar
4. Look for **"Connection Pooling"** section
5. You should see **"Transaction"** mode
6. Copy the connection string that looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://postgres.[project-ref]:[password]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
   ```

**Key differences:**
- Direct connection: `db.kmswrzzlirdfnzzbnrpo.supabase.co:5432`
- Pooled connection: `aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:6543`

## Alternative Solution

If you can't find the pooled connection string, we can modify the code to use `createClient()` instead of the `sql` template tag, which will work with direct connections.

Would you like me to:
1. **Wait for the pooled connection string** (recommended)
2. **Modify the code to use createClient()** (alternative)

**Current Status:** Waiting for pooled connection string from Supabase
