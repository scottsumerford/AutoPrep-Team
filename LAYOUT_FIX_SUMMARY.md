# Profile Page Layout Fix - Complete Summary

## Issue Identified
The new Profile Overview layout with FileUploadSection and GeneratedReportsSection was not displaying on the production site because these components were positioned OUTSIDE the left column div instead of INSIDE it.

## Root Cause
The layout structure had:
```
<div className="lg:col-span-1">
  <Card>Profile Overview</Card>
</div>  ← LEFT COLUMN CLOSED HERE

{/* File Upload Section */}
<FileUploadSection />

{/* Generated Reports Section */}
<GeneratedReportsSection />

<div className="lg:col-span-2">Calendar and Events</div>
```

This caused the FileUploadSection and GeneratedReportsSection to appear OUTSIDE the grid layout.

## Solution Applied
Moved the components INSIDE the left column:
```
<div className="lg:col-span-1">
  <Card>Profile Overview</Card>

  {/* File Upload Section */}
  <FileUploadSection />

  {/* Generated Reports Section */}
  <GeneratedReportsSection />
</div>  ← LEFT COLUMN CLOSED HERE

<div className="lg:col-span-2">Calendar and Events</div>
```
