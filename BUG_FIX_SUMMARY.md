# Bug Fix Summary: "Generate Pre-Sales Report" Button Not Working

## Problem Statement
When clicking the "Generate Pre-Sales Report" button on the North Texas Shutters profile, nothing happens. The button doesn't show any loading state, and no report is generated.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: Frontend Sending Wrong Event ID (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: The frontend was sending `event.event_id` (Google/Outlook event ID - a string like "google_event_123") instead of `event.id` (database primary key - a number like 1).

**Location**: `app/profile/[slug]/page.tsx` line in `handleGeneratePresalesReport` function

**Before (❌ Broken)**:
```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({
  event_id: event.event_id,  // Wrong! This is the Google/Outlook event ID
  event_title: event.title,
  event_description: event.description || '',
  attendee_email: profile?.email || '',
}),
```

**After (✅ Fixed)**:
```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({
  event_id: event.id,  // Correct! This is the database primary key
  event_title: event.title,
  event_description: event.description || '',
  attendee_email: profile?.email || '',
}),
```

**Impact**: This caused the API to fail with "Event not found" error, preventing the webhook from being triggered.

### Issue #2: Production Database Not Configured (CRITICAL ⚠️)
**Problem**: The production site (https://team.autoprep.ai) is using **in-memory storage** instead of a persistent PostgreSQL database because the `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable is not set in Vercel.

**Consequences**:
- ❌ Calendar events synced from Google Calendar are NOT persisted
- ❌ Pre-sales report status cannot be stored in the database
- ❌ All data is lost when the server restarts
- ❌ The "Generate Pre-Sales Report" button cannot work without a database

**Solution**: Configure PostgreSQL on Vercel (see PRODUCTION_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

### Issue #3: Missing Database Columns (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: The production database schema was missing the presales_report and slides columns.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `lib/db/schema.sql` to include all presales and slides columns
- Created `/api/db/migrate` endpoint to add missing columns to existing databases
- Updated `initializeDatabase()` function to include ALTER TABLE statements

## Files Modified

1. **app/profile/[slug]/page.tsx** - Fixed event ID in presales report handler
2. **lib/db/schema.sql** - Added presales_report and slides columns to schema
3. **app/api/db/migrate/route.ts** - Created migration endpoint
4. **PRODUCTION_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Created comprehensive setup guide

## Testing Results

### Local Testing ✅
- Database schema updated with presales columns
- Test event created in local database
- API endpoint responds correctly with event found
- Presales report handler sends correct event ID

### Production Testing ⚠️
- Code fix deployed to GitHub
- Vercel auto-deployed the changes
- API endpoints are working
- **BUT**: Production database is not configured (using in-memory storage)
- Calendar events are not persisting
- Pre-sales reports cannot be generated without a persistent database

## What Needs to Be Done

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Configure PostgreSQL on Vercel** (CRITICAL)
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Create a Postgres database or connect an external one
   - Set `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable
   - Redeploy the application

2. **Initialize Production Database**
   - Call `POST /api/db/init` to create tables
   - Call `POST /api/db/migrate` to add missing columns

3. **Sync Calendar Events**
   - Call `POST /api/calendar/sync` with profile_id=1
   - Verify events appear in the database

4. **Test the Complete Workflow**
   - Go to https://team.autoprep.ai/profile/north-texas-shutters
   - Click "Generate Pre-Sales Report" on an event
   - Verify button shows "Generating..." with spinner
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for Lindy agent to process
   - Verify button changes to green "Download Report"
   - Download and verify the PDF

## Integration Flow (After Database is Configured)

```
1. User clicks "Generate Pre-Sales Report" button
   ↓
2. Frontend calls POST /api/lindy/presales-report with event.id (FIXED ✅)
   ↓
3. Backend validates event exists in database
   ↓
4. Backend updates status to "processing"
   ↓
5. Backend calls Lindy webhook with Bearer token
   ↓
6. Lindy agent (ID: 68aa4cb7ebbc5f9222a2696e) receives request
   ↓
7. Agent researches company/attendee information
   ↓
8. Agent generates PDF pre-sales report
   ↓
9. Agent uploads PDF to storage
   ↓
10. Agent calls POST /api/lindy/webhook with PDF URL
    ↓
11. Backend updates database with PDF URL and status "completed"
    ↓
12. Frontend auto-refresh detects status change
    ↓
13. Button changes to green "Download Report"
    ↓
14. User downloads PDF ✅
```

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Frontend Code | ✅ FIXED | Event ID corrected |
| API Endpoints | ✅ READY | All routes implemented |
| Webhook Integration | ✅ READY | Authentication configured |
| Database Schema | ✅ READY | Presales columns added |
| Database Connection | ❌ NOT CONFIGURED | POSTGRES_URL not set on Vercel |
| Calendar Sync | ✅ WORKING | Events sync but don't persist |
| Pre-Sales Reports | ❌ BLOCKED | Cannot work without persistent database |

## Next Steps

1. **URGENT**: Configure PostgreSQL database on Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Redeploy the application
4. Initialize and migrate the production database
5. Sync calendar events
6. Test the complete workflow

See PRODUCTION_SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions.
