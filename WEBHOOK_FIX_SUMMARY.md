# Pre-Sales Report Webhook Fix - Summary

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Deployed to Production  
**Deployment ID:** 4CsUaiVvD  
**Commit:** 90068da  

## Problem

The "Generate Pre-Sales Report" button was not functioning correctly. The webhook call to the Lindy Pre-Sales Report agent was using an incorrect authentication header format.

### Root Cause

The webhook was being called with:
```
X-Webhook-Secret: [secret-value]
```

But according to the MASTER_AGENT_GUIDE.md and Lindy webhook documentation, it should use:
```
Authorization: Bearer [secret-value]
```

## Solution

Updated `/app/api/lindy/presales-report/route.ts` to:

1. **Use correct authentication header**: Changed from `X-Webhook-Secret` to `Authorization: Bearer`
2. **Added validation**: Ensured webhook secret is configured before attempting to call the webhook
3. **Improved logging**: Added clear logging for authentication method being used

### Changes Made

**File:** `app/api/lindy/presales-report/route.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE (Incorrect)
const headers: HeadersInit = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
};

const webhookSecret = process.env.LINDY_PRESALES_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
if (webhookSecret) {
  headers['X-Webhook-Secret'] = webhookSecret;
}

// AFTER (Correct)
const webhookSecret = process.env.LINDY_PRESALES_WEBHOOK_SECRET;

if (!webhookSecret) {
  console.error('❌ Lindy presales webhook secret not configured');
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    success: false, 
    error: 'Lindy presales webhook secret not configured' 
  }, { status: 500 });
}

const headers: HeadersInit = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${webhookSecret}`,
};
```

## Verification

✅ **Build Status:** Successful (no TypeScript or ESLint errors)  
✅ **Deployment Status:** Ready (46 seconds)  
✅ **Production URL:** https://team.autoprep.ai  
✅ **Slides webhook:** Already using correct `Authorization: Bearer` format  

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Navigate to https://team.autoprep.ai
2. Go to a profile with connected calendar events
3. Click "Generate Pre-Sales Report" button on any event
4. The button should show "Generating..." state
5. The Lindy Pre-Sales Report agent should receive the webhook call with proper authentication
6. Report should be generated and available for download

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in Vercel environment variables:

```
LINDY_PRESALES_WEBHOOK_URL=https://public.lindy.ai/api/v1/webhooks/lindy/b149f3a8-2679-4d0b-b4ba-7dfb5f399eaa
