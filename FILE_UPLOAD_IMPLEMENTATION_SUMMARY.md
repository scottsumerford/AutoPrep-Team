- Automatic Airtable Record ID generation for each user profile

### 3. **File Upload API Endpoint** (`app/api/files/upload/route.ts`)
- POST endpoint for handling file uploads
- File type and size validation
- Base64 encoding for file storage
- Automatic Airtable record creation on first upload
- Database synchronization with airtable_record_id

### 4. **Database Schema Updates**

- Includes `user_profile_id` for agent reference
- Retrieves profile information before triggering agent

#### Slides Generation Webhook (`app/api/lindy/slides/route.ts`)
