# File Upload Issue - Root Cause & Resolution

## Problem Identified

The file upload feature was failing with "Failed to upload file" error when users attempted to upload files (Company Information, Slides, etc.) to their profile.

### Root Cause

**Airtable Table Mismatch**: The code was configured to use the wrong Airtable table:
- **Configured Table**: `tbl3xkB7fGkC10CGN` (Meetings table)
- **Expected Table**: Profiles table (did not exist)

The Meetings table has completely different fields:
- Company Name
- Meeting Date
- Meeting Title
- Report Content
- etc.

But the file upload code was trying to create records with:
- Profile ID
- Profile Name
- Profile Email
- Company Info URL
- Slides URL

This field mismatch caused the Airtable API to reject all file upload requests with `UNKNOWN_FIELD_NAME` errors.

## Solution Implemented

### Step 1: Created Profiles Table in Airtable ✅

Created a new dedicated Profiles table with the correct fields:

```
Table ID: tbl2mjvZZG6ExhNbC
Table Name: Profiles

Fields:
- Profile ID (number)
- Profile Name (singleLineText)
- Profile Email (email)
- Company Info URL (url)
- Slides URL (url)
- Created At (date)
```

### Step 2: Updated Code Configuration ✅

Updated `lib/airtable.ts` to use the new Profiles table:

```typescript
// Before:
const AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID = process.env.AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID || 'tbl3xkB7fGkC10CGN';

// After:
const AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID = process.env.AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID || 'tbl2mjvZZG6ExhNbC';
```

### Step 3: Tested File Upload Flow ✅

Verified the complete file upload process:
- ✅ Create profile records with file URLs
- ✅ Update profile records with additional files
- ✅ Store base64-encoded files in Airtable
- ✅ Delete records (cleanup)

## File Upload Process (Now Working)

```
1. User uploads file via FileUploadSection component
   ↓
2. File sent to /api/files/upload endpoint
   ↓
3. File validated (type, size limits)
   ↓
4. Profile retrieved from database
   ↓
5. If no Airtable record exists, create new record in Profiles table
   ↓
6. File converted to base64 data URL
   ↓
7. Database updated with file URL
   ↓
8. Airtable Profiles table updated via updateProfileFilesInAirtable()
   ↓
9. ✅ File upload complete
```

## Deployment Status

### Git Commit
```
Commit: bd3107f
Message: fix: Update Airtable table ID to new Profiles table (tbl2mjvZZG6ExhNbC)
Status: ✅ Pushed to main branch
```

### Production Deployment
- **Status**: ✅ Auto-deployed to Vercel
- **URL**: https://team.autoprep.ai
- **Expected Availability**: Within 2-5 minutes of commit

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Airtable Profiles table created with correct fields
- [x] Table ID updated in code (tbl2mjvZZG6ExhNbC)
- [x] File upload API tested and working
- [x] Create/Update/Delete operations verified
- [x] Code committed and pushed to main
- [x] Production deployment triggered

## Next Steps for User

1. **Wait for Deployment**: Vercel will auto-deploy within 2-5 minutes
2. **Test File Upload**: Try uploading a file to your profile
3. **Verify in Airtable**: Check that files appear in the Profiles table
4. **Report Any Issues**: If upload still fails, check browser console for errors

## Technical Details

### Airtable Configuration
- **Base ID**: appUwKSnmMH7TVgvf
- **Profiles Table ID**: tbl2mjvZZG6ExhNbC (NEW)
- **Meetings Table ID**: tbl3xkB7fGkC10CGN (unchanged)
- **API Key**: Configured in environment variables

### File Storage Format
Files are stored as base64-encoded data URLs:
```
data:text/plain;base64,VGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3QgZmlsZQ==
data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQK...
```

### Database Integration
- Files are stored in both:
  1. **PostgreSQL** (Supabase): File URLs in calendar_events table
  2. **Airtable**: File URLs in Profiles table

## Summary

✅ **Issue**: File upload failing due to wrong Airtable table
✅ **Root Cause**: Profiles table didn't exist, code used Meetings table
✅ **Solution**: Created Profiles table, updated table ID in code
✅ **Status**: Fixed and deployed to production
✅ **Testing**: All file upload operations verified working

The file upload feature should now work correctly!
