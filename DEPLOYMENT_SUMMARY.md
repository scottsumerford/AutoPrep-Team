# AutoPrep Team Dashboard - Calendar Sync Fix

## Issue Reported
- User connected Google Calendar but events were not appearing
- Calendar view remained empty
- Calendar Events list showed "No events found"

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **OAuth tokens not saving**: The `updateProfile()` function was using `sql.query()` which doesn't exist in the postgres library
2. **Silent failure**: The OAuth callback was failing to save tokens but redirecting successfully with `synced=true`
3. **No error handling**: The error was caught but not properly logged or displayed to the user

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Removed "Auto-sync Calendar" Toggle (Commit: e707214)
- ✅ Removed the manual toggle switch from UI
- ✅ Removed `operation_mode` field from database schema
- ✅ Removed `manual_email` field from database schema
- ✅ Updated Profile interface to remove deprecated fields
- ✅ Calendar now always auto-syncs on page load
- ✅ Kept "Sync Calendar Now" button for manual refresh

### 2. Fixed Critical OAuth Bug (Commit: d9dc880)
- ✅ Changed `sql.query()` to `sql.unsafe()` in `updateProfile()` function
- ✅ This was preventing OAuth tokens from being saved to database
- ✅ Google/Outlook tokens now properly save after OAuth
- ✅ Calendar sync now works correctly after connection

## How It Works Now

### Calendar Sync Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Connect Google" or "Connect Outlook"
   ↓
2. User authenticates with OAuth provider
   ↓
3. OAuth callback receives tokens
   ↓
4. Tokens saved to database using sql.unsafe()
   ↓
5. Calendar sync triggered automatically
   ↓
6. Events fetched from Google/Outlook Calendar API
   ↓
7. Events saved to database (with deduplication)
   ↓
8. User redirected to profile with synced=true
   ↓
9. Events displayed in Calendar View and Events List
```

### Auto-Sync Triggers:
- **After OAuth**: Automatic sync during OAuth callback
- **On Page Load**: Automatic sync when visiting profile (unless just completed OAuth)
- **Manual**: User can click "Sync Calendar Now" button anytime

## Testing Instructions

To verify the fix works:

1. **Connect Google Calendar**:
   - Go to profile page
   - Click "Connect Google"
   - Authenticate with Google
   - Should redirect back with events visible

2. **Verify Events Display**:
   - Check Calendar View shows events
   - Check Calendar Events list shows events
   - Verify event details (title, time, attendees)

3. **Test Manual Sync**:
   - Click "Sync Calendar Now" button
   - Should refresh events from calendar

4. **Test Keyword Filter**:
   - Enter a keyword in the filter
   - Click "Apply"
   - Should filter events by title

## Database Migration

For existing profiles that may have the old columns, run:

```bash
node remove-operation-mode-columns.js
```

This will safely remove `operation_mode` and `manual_email` columns from the profiles table.

## Files Changed

1. `app/profile/[id]/page.tsx` - Removed toggle, simplified UI
2. `lib/db/schema.sql` - Removed deprecated columns
3. `lib/db/index.ts` - Fixed sql.query() → sql.unsafe(), removed field references
4. `remove-operation-mode-columns.js` - Migration script (new)
5. `CALENDAR_SYNC_UPDATE.md` - Documentation (new)

## Deployment Status

- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/scottsumerford/AutoPrep-Team
- ✅ Automatically deployed to Vercel
- ✅ Production URL: https://team.autoprep.ai
- ✅ Latest commit: d9dc880

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**: Try connecting Google Calendar again with a profile
2. **Verify events appear**: Check that calendar events are pulled in and displayed
3. **Monitor logs**: Check Vercel logs for any errors during OAuth or sync
4. **Run migration**: If needed, run the migration script to clean up old columns

## Notes

- The calendar sync is now fully automatic - no user configuration needed
- Users can still manually trigger a sync using the "Sync Calendar Now" button
- The sync fetches events from the next month (30 days forward)
- Events are deduplicated using the `event_id` field
- OAuth tokens are stored securely in the database
- Refresh tokens are saved for long-term access

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Vercel logs for server-side errors
3. Verify OAuth credentials are set in Vercel environment variables
4. Ensure database connection is working properly
