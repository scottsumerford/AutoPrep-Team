# AutoPrep Team Dashboard - Feature Deployment Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE AND READY FOR PRODUCTION  
**Developer:** AutoPrep App Developer  
**Client:** Scott Sumerford

---

## Executive Summary

Two critical features have been successfully implemented, tested, and deployed to the AutoPrep Team Dashboard:

1. **15-Minute Timeout Retry Logic** - Automatically detects and marks stale presales reports/slides as failed, showing a "Try again" button for users to retry
2. **Calendar Sync Deletion** - Provides true bidirectional synchronization by removing events deleted from Google Calendar or Outlook

Both features are production-ready and have been committed to the main branch.

---

## Feature 1: 15-Minute Timeout Retry Logic

### Problem
- Presales reports could get stuck in "processing" status indefinitely
- Users had no way to retry failed or timed-out operations
- No automatic cleanup of stale processing runs

### Solution
- Automatic detection of stale runs (>15 minutes in processing status without URL)
- Marks stale runs as failed automatically
- Shows "Try again" button for users to retry
- Cleanup happens on every API request

### User Experience Flow
1. User clicks "PDF Pre-sales Report" → "Generating Report..." (spinner)
2. If completes within 15 minutes → "Download PDF Report" (green button)
3. If times out (>15 minutes) → "Try again" (red destructive button)
4. User can click "Try again" to retry the operation

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Functions:** `markStalePresalesRuns()`, `markStaleSlidesRuns()`
- **API Routes:** Updated presales-report and slides routes with cleanup calls
- **Frontend:** Added `isReportStale()` and `areSlidesStale()` helper functions
- **UI Updates:** Button logic updated to show "Try again" for stale operations

### Files Modified
- `lib/db/index.ts` - Added 2 database functions
- `app/api/lindy/presales-report/route.ts` - Added cleanup call
- `app/api/lindy/slides/route.ts` - Added cleanup call
- `app/profile/[id]/page.tsx` - Added stale detection UI logic

## Feature 2: Calendar Sync Deletion (Bidirectional Sync)

### Problem
- Calendar sync only added/updated events, never deleted them
- Deleted events remained in AutoPrep database indefinitely
- No true bidirectional synchronization with remote calendars

### Solution
- Compares local events with remote calendar events
- Deletes events that no longer exist in remote calendar
- Handles Google Calendar and Outlook independently
- Returns count of deleted events in sync response

### User Experience Flow
1. User clicks "Sync Calendar Now"
2. System fetches all events from Google Calendar and/or Outlook
3. System compares local vs remote events
4. Deleted events are removed from AutoPrep
5. New/updated events are synced
6. User sees: "Successfully synced X events and deleted Y removed events"

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Function:** `deleteRemovedCalendarEvents(profileId, source, remoteEventIds)`
- **API Route:** Updated calendar sync route with deletion logic
- **Response:** Updated to include `deleted_events` count

### Files Modified
- `lib/db/index.ts` - Added 1 database function
- `app/api/calendar/sync/route.ts` - Added deletion logic and updated response

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- All code committed to main branch ✅
- All tests passed ✅
- Documentation complete ✅

### Deployment Steps
1. Changes are already committed to main branch
2. Vercel will automatically deploy on push to main
3. No database migrations needed
4. No environment variable changes needed
5. Deployment should complete within 2-3 minutes

### Verification Steps
1. Visit https://team.autoprep.ai/profile/3 (North Texas Shutters)
2. Verify profile page loads correctly
3. Check that "Try again" button appears for stale reports
4. Test calendar sync deletion with a test event

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur, revert to previous commit:
```bash
git revert 82da5d9
```

---

## Database Schema

### Existing Columns Used
- `presales_report_status` - Status of presales report generation
- `presales_report_url` - URL to generated presales report
- `slides_status` - Status of slides generation
- `slides_url` - URL to generated slides
- `created_at` - Event creation timestamp
- `event_id` - Remote calendar event ID
- `source` - Calendar source (google/outlook)

### No Migrations Required
Both features use existing database columns. No schema changes needed.

---

## Configuration

### Timeout Threshold
- **Value:** 15 minutes
- **Location:** Hardcoded in database functions
- **Future:** Can be made configurable per profile

### Cleanup Trigger
- **Presales Reports:** Every presales-report API request
- **Slides:** Every slides API request
- **Calendar Sync:** Every calendar sync API request

### Sync Scope
- **Date Range:** Next 30 days from current date
- **Sources:** Google Calendar and Outlook

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable Timeout**
   - Make 15-minute timeout configurable per profile
   - Allow different timeouts for different report types

2. **Notifications**
   - Email notifications for timeouts
   - In-app notifications for sync deletions

3. **Automatic Retry**
   - Implement automatic retry logic
   - Exponential backoff for failed retries

4. **Sync History**
   - Track sync history and deleted events
   - Provide audit trail for calendar changes

5. **Advanced Sync**
   - Allow syncing specific date ranges
   - Selective event sync based on keywords

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Try again" button not appearing for stale reports
- **Solution:** Ensure `created_at` timestamp is set correctly in database
- **Check:** Verify presales_report_status is 'processing' and presales_report_url is NULL

**Issue:** Calendar events not being deleted after sync
- **Solution:** Verify event_id and source fields are populated correctly
- **Check:** Ensure remote event IDs are being extracted correctly from API response

**Issue:** Deployment fails
- **Solution:** Check Vercel logs for errors
- **Rollback:** Use `git revert 82da5d9` to revert changes
