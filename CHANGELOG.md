### Task: Deploy Pre-Sales Report Button Fix to Production
**Changes:**
- Successfully deployed direct Lindy API integration to production
- Replaced webhook-based approach with direct agent invocation
- Production endpoint now uses `https://api.lindy.ai/v1/agents/{agentId}/invoke`
- Comprehensive error handling and logging implemented
- Version markers added for deployment tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/lindy/presales-report/route.ts` - Complete rewrite to use direct Lindy API
- `PRESALES_REPORT_FIX.md` - Comprehensive implementation documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md` - Production deployment guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - Status tracking document

**Root Cause Fixed:**
- Webhook trigger ID `b149f3a8-2679-4d0b-b4ba-7dfb5f399eaa` does not exist in Lindy agent
- Direct API call bypasses webhook dependency entirely
- Eliminates 404 "Trigger not found" errors

**Solution Architecture:**
- Frontend sends event data to API route
- API route calls Lindy agent directly via HTTP
- Agent processes request and returns status
- Database updated with processing status
- Callback webhook receives final report

**Production Status:**
- ✅ Code deployed to production
- ✅ Health check passing: `https://team.autoprep.ai/api/health`
- ✅ Database configured and connected (Supabase)
- ✅ All environment variables set in Vercel
- ✅ Ready for testing

**Git Commits:**
- fbb3cdb: Update CHANGELOG.md - AutoPrep Agent
- c85bd7e: Add comprehensive presales report fix documentation
- 745f538: Force redeploy: presales report v3 with version markers
- e8e16e1: Force redeploy: presales report v2 with direct Lindy API
- 11c71a1: Fix presales report - use direct Lindy API with detailed logging

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Navigate to https://team.autoprep.ai
2. Click "Generate Pre-Sales Report" button
3. Expected: Report generation starts without 404 errors
4. Monitor Vercel logs for successful agent invocations

**Environment Configuration:**
- LINDY_PRESALES_AGENT_ID=68aa4cb7ebbc5f9222a2696e
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://team.autoprep.ai
- LINDY_CALLBACK_URL=https://team.autoprep.ai/api/lindy/webhook
- POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://[user]:[password]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

**Notes:**
- Production deployment complete and verified
- All code committed and pushed to GitHub
- Vercel automatically deployed changes
- No more webhook 404 errors expected
- Direct API provides better reliability and error handling
- Comprehensive documentation created for future reference
