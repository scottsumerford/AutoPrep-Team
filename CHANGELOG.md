### Task: Implement Webhook Functionality for Pre-Sales Report and Slides Generation

**Changes:**
- Fixed webhook payload format to match WEBHOOK_TRIGGER_IMPLEMENTATION.md specifications
- Updated `/api/lindy/presales-report` route with correct payload structure
- Updated `/api/lindy/slides` route with correct payload structure
- Implemented proper Bearer token authentication header for webhook calls
- Payload now includes: `calendar_event_id`, `event_title`, `event_description`, `attendee_email`, `webhook_url`
- Both routes properly retrieve webhook URLs and secrets from environment variables
- Routes update database status to "processing" before calling Lindy webhooks
- Webhook callback endpoint (`/api/lindy/webhook`) ready to receive agent responses

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/lindy/presales-report/route.ts` - Corrected payload format and authentication
- `app/api/lindy/slides/route.ts` - Corrected payload format and authentication

**Environment Variables Configured:**
- `LINDY_PRESALES_WEBHOOK_URL` - Lindy pre-sales agent webhook endpoint
- `LINDY_PRESALES_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Bearer token for pre-sales webhook authentication
- `LINDY_SLIDES_WEBHOOK_URL` - Lindy slides agent webhook endpoint
- `LINDY_SLIDES_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Bearer token for slides webhook authentication

**Workflow Implementation:**
1. User clicks "Generate Pre-Sales Report" or "Generate Slides" button on profile page
2. Frontend calls `/api/lindy/presales-report` or `/api/lindy/slides` API endpoint
3. Backend updates database status to "processing"
4. Backend calls Lindy webhook with correct payload and Bearer token authentication
5. Lindy agent receives webhook trigger and processes request
6. Agent calls `/api/lindy/webhook` callback with results (PDF/slides URL)
7. Backend updates database with URL and status "completed"
8. Frontend auto-refresh detects status change and displays download link

**Deployment Status:**
- ✅ Changes committed to GitHub (commit `2c4d25b`)
- ✅ Pushed to main branch
- ✅ Vercel auto-deploy triggered
- ✅ Production site live at https://team.autoprep.ai

**Notes:**
- Webhook secrets are now properly stored in environment variables (not exposed client-side)
- All webhook calls are made server-side for security
- Database status tracking enables frontend polling for real-time updates
- Callback URL is configurable via `LINDY_CALLBACK_URL` environment variable
- Both pre-sales and slides agents use the same callback endpoint with agent_id differentiation

### Task: Implement Webhook Trigger Functionality for AutoPrep Team Dashboard

**Changes:**
- Moved webhook calls from client-side to server-side API endpoints for security
- Updated profile page handlers to call API endpoints instead of webhooks directly

- All webhook calls now made from secure server-side API routes
- Client-side code only calls internal API endpoints

**Notes:**
- API routes handle webhook authentication and payload construction
- Database status updates enable real-time frontend polling
- Callback endpoint ready to receive Lindy agent responses
