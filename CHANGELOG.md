### Added

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **15-Minute Timeout Retry Logic** - Fixed "Generating Report..." showing indefinitely
  - Added `presales_report_started_at` and `slides_started_at` columns to track when processing started

- **Calendar Sync Deletion** - Fixed SQL injection vulnerability and deletion logic
  - Replaced unsafe `sql.unsafe()` with proper parameterized queries

  - Verified deletion logic with test data

#### Database Schema
- Added `presales_report_started_at` TIMESTAMP column to `calendar_events` table
- Added `slides_started_at` TIMESTAMP column to `calendar_events` table
- Both columns track when report/slides generation processing started

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/lindy/presales-report` - Trigger pre-sales report generation
- `POST /api/lindy/slides` - Trigger slides generation

- `POST /api/calendar/sync` - Sync calendar events from Google/Outlook

#### Database Functions
- `updateEventPresalesStatus(eventId, status, url?)` - Update pre-sales report status
- `updateEventSlidesStatus(eventId, status, url?)` - Update slides status
- `markStalePresalesRuns()` - Mark reports > 15 minutes as failed
- `markStaleSlidesRuns()` - Mark slides > 15 minutes as failed
- `deleteRemovedCalendarEvents(profileId, source, remoteEventIds)` - Delete events not in remote calendar

#### Documentation
- Created `MASTER_AGENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide for all environment variables, credentials, and integrations
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and change tracking
- Updated `.env.example` - Consistent environment variable template

#### Code Standards
- Established naming conventions for database columns, functions, and variables
- Established SQL query standards (parameterized queries, no string interpolation)
- Established TypeScript standards (strict null checks, interface definitions)

### Changed

#### Database Layer (lib/db/index.ts)
- Updated `CalendarEvent` interface to include `presales_report_started_at` and `slides_started_at`
- Modified `updateEventPresalesStatus()` to set `presales_report_started_at` when status becomes 'processing'
- Modified `updateEventSlidesStatus()` to set `slides_started_at` when status becomes 'processing'
- Fixed `deleteRemovedCalendarEvents()` to use parameterized SQL queries

#### Frontend (app/profile/[id]/page.tsx)
- Updated `CalendarEvent` interface to include new timestamp fields
- Updated `isReportStale()` function to check `presales_report_started_at` instead of `created_at`
- Updated `areSlidesStale()` function to check `slides_started_at` instead of `created_at`

#### API Routes
- Updated `app/api/lindy/presales-report/route.ts` with proper type annotations
- Updated `app/api/lindy/slides/route.ts` with proper type annotations
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors

### Fixed

- Fixed 15-minute timeout retry logic not working correctly
- Fixed calendar sync deletion SQL errors
- Fixed database connection issues with environment variables
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in API routes
- Fixed stale detection checking wrong timestamp field

### Security

- Replaced unsafe SQL string interpolation with parameterized queries
- Added Bearer token authentication to webhook calls
- Verified webhook secrets are properly configured

### Verified

- ‚úÖ Database schema updated with new columns
- ‚úÖ Database functions fixed to set started_at timestamps
- ‚úÖ Frontend logic updated to use correct timestamp fields
- ‚úÖ SQL queries fixed to use parameterized queries
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
- ‚úÖ Build successful with no errors
- ‚úÖ Both critical bugs tested and confirmed working
- ‚úÖ Calendar sync deletion tested with test data
- ‚úÖ Stale detection tested with various time scenarios

### Environment Variables

All environment variables are now documented in `MASTER_AGENT_GUIDE.md` with:
- Complete list of all variables
- Usage map showing where each variable is used
- Local development values
- Production values
- Naming conventions and prefixes

### Migration Notes

**For Existing Deployments:**

1. Add new columns to `calendar_events` table:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE calendar_events
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS presales_report_started_at TIMESTAMP,
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS slides_started_at TIMESTAMP;
   ```

2. Update environment variables in Vercel:
   - Verify all `LINDY_*` variables are set
   - Verify all `GOOGLE_*` variables are set
   - Verify all `MICROSOFT_*` variables are set
   - Verify `NEXTAUTH_*` variables are set

3. Redeploy application after schema changes

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing data remains intact
- No data migration required
