### Task: Fix Lindy Agent Integration - Implement Direct API Triggering

**Changes:**
- Updated `/app/api/lindy/presales-report/route.ts` to use Lindy API directly instead of webhook URLs
- Updated `/app/api/lindy/slides/route.ts` to use Lindy API directly instead of webhook URLs
- Changed authentication from Bearer token to Lindy API key authentication
- Now calls `https://api.lindy.ai/v1/agents/{agentId}/invoke` endpoint
- Uses `LINDY_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication
- Removed dependency on non-functional webhook URLs that were returning "Trigger not found" errors
- Added `LINDY_API_KEY`, `LINDY_PRESALES_AGENT_ID`, and `LINDY_SLIDES_AGENT_ID` to `.env` file

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/lindy/presales-report/route.ts`
- `app/api/lindy/slides/route.ts`
- `.env`

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The previous implementation was attempting to trigger Lindy agents via webhook URLs:
- `LINDY_PRESALES_WEBHOOK_URL=https://public.lindy.ai/api/v1/webhooks/lindy/b149f3a8-2679-4d0b-b4ba-7dfb5f399eaa`
- `LINDY_SLIDES_WEBHOOK_URL=https://public.lindy.ai/api/v1/webhooks/lindy/66bf87f2-034e-463b-a7da-83e9adbf03d4`

However, these webhook endpoints were returning `{"data":{"success":false,"message":"Trigger not found"}}`, indicating the Lindy agents were not configured to accept webhook triggers in this format.

**Solution Implemented:**
The fix implements direct API invocation using the Lindy API endpoint:
- Pre-sales Agent: `https://api.lindy.ai/v1/agents/68aa4cb7ebbc5f9222a2696e/invoke`
- Slides Agent: `https://api.lindy.ai/v1/agents/68ed392b02927e7ace232732/invoke`

This approach:
1. Sends the event data directly to the Lindy API
2. Uses Bearer token authentication with `LINDY_API_KEY`
3. Wraps the payload in `{ input: agentPayload }` format
4. Properly handles agent responses and errors

**Deployment Status:**
- ✅ Code changes committed and pushed to GitHub (commit: dad22e3)
- ✅ Vercel will auto-deploy from main branch
- ⏳ **REQUIRED**: Add `LINDY_API_KEY` environment variable to Vercel

**Next Steps:**
1. **Get Lindy API Key**: Go to https://app.lindy.ai/settings/api-keys and create/copy API key
2. **Configure Vercel**: 
   - Go to https://vercel.com/scottsumerford/autoprep-team/settings/environment-variables
   - Add new variable: `LINDY_API_KEY` = (your API key)
   - Set for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
3. **Verify Deployment**: Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to redeploy with new environment variable
4. **Test**: Click "Generate Pre-Sales Report" button on a calendar event and verify it works

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Navigate to https://team.autoprep.ai/profile/north-texas-shutters
2. Click "Generate Pre-Sales Report" on "First test meet" event
3. Button should show "Generating Report..." with spinner
4. Wait 30-60 seconds for agent to process
5. Button should turn green "Download PDF Report"
6. Click to download and verify PDF was generated

**Important Notes:**
- The webhook callback endpoint `/api/lindy/webhook` remains unchanged and will receive agent responses
- Database schema already has all required columns for tracking report/slides status
- Frontend polling will automatically detect status changes and update UI
- All previous security fixes (server-side webhook calls, no exposed secrets) are maintained

### Task: Investigate Webhook Integration Issues

**Changes:**
- Tested webhook endpoints to identify root cause of "Generate Report" button failures
- Discovered webhook URLs returning "Trigger not found" error
- Identified that webhook-based triggering approach was not working
- Reviewed COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md which documented the need for Lindy API direct invocation
- Found that previous fix documentation existed but code was never updated

**Files Modified:**
- None (investigation only)

**Findings:**
- Webhook URL: `https://public.lindy.ai/api/v1/webhooks/lindy/b149f3a8-2679-4d0b-b4ba-7dfb5f399eaa`
- Response: `{"data":{"success":false,"message":"Trigger not found"}}`
- This indicated the Lindy agents were not configured to accept webhook triggers
- The correct approach is to use Lindy API direct invocation with `LINDY_API_KEY`

**Status:**
- ✅ Root cause identified
- ✅ Solution documented in COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
- ⏳ Implementation in progress

### Task: Test Webhook API Endpoint

**Changes:**
- Tested `/api/lindy/presales-report` endpoint on production
- Confirmed API route is deployed and accessible
- Verified endpoint returns proper error messages for invalid event IDs
- Tested Lindy webhook URL directly to identify integration issues

**Files Modified:**
- None (testing only)

**Test Results:**
- ✅ API endpoint accessible: `POST https://team.autoprep.ai/api/lindy/presales-report`
- ✅ Returns 404 for non-existent events
- ✅ Returns proper JSON error responses
- ❌ Lindy webhook URL returns "Trigger not found" error
- ❌ Webhook-based triggering not working

**Status:**
- ✅ API routes deployed to production
- ❌ Webhook integration failing
- ⏳ Root cause analysis in progress
