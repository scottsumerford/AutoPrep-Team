### Task: Refactor Lindy Agent Webhook Integration
**Changes:**
- Removed "Report: pending" and "Slides: pending" status labels from event cards
- Updated button text to "Generate Pre-Sales Report" and "Generate Slides" for clarity
- Modified webhook integration to call Lindy agent webhooks directly instead of through API endpoints
- Integrated webhook secrets for authentication with Lindy agents
- Updated button states to show:
  - "Generate Pre-Sales Report" / "Generate Slides" for pending status
  - Loading spinner with "Generating Report..." / "Generating Slides..." for processing status
  - "Download Report" / "Download Slides" links for completed status
  - Error states for failed generations
  - "Try again" button for stale (>15 min) processing requests

**Files Modified:**
- `app/profile/[slug]/page.tsx` - Updated event card UI and webhook integration

**Webhook URLs Configured:**
- Pre-sales Report: `https://public.lindy.ai/api/v1/webhooks/lindy/b149f3a8-2679-4d0b-b4ba-7dfb5f399eaa`
- Slides Generation: `https://public.lindy.ai/api/v1/webhooks/lindy/66bf87f2-034e-463b-a7da-83e9adbf03d4`

**Notes:**
- Webhook secrets are passed via `X-Webhook-Secret` header for authentication
- Payload includes: `calendar_event_id`, `event_title`, `event_description`, `attendee_email`
- Direct webhook calls eliminate the need for intermediate API endpoints
- UI now provides better visual feedback for each generation state
- Stale processing requests (>15 minutes without completion) show retry option

**Git Commits:**
- `247ce7d` - refactor: remove 'Report: pending' and 'Slides: pending' labels; call Lindy webhooks directly with secrets
