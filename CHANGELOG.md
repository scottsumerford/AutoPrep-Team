### Task: Secure Webhook Integration - Move Secrets to Server-Side

**Changes:**
- Refactored webhook calls from client-side to server-side API endpoints
- Removed exposure of webhook secrets via NEXT_PUBLIC_ environment variables
- Updated handleGeneratePresalesReport to call /api/lindy/presales-report endpoint
- Updated handleGenerateSlides to call /api/lindy/slides endpoint
- Webhook secrets now remain server-side only in API routes
- Improved security posture by eliminating client-side exposure of authentication details

**Security Improvements:**
- Webhook URLs and secrets no longer exposed to browser/client
- All webhook authentication now handled server-side in API routes
- Reduced attack surface for credential exposure
- Maintains same user experience with proper loading states and error handling

**Files Modified:**
- `app/profile/[slug]/page.tsx` - Updated button handlers to use API endpoints

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `/api/lindy/presales-report` (POST) - Server-side pre-sales report generation
- `/api/lindy/slides` (POST) - Server-side slides generation

**Notes:**
- API routes already had proper server-side webhook integration
- This change completes the security refactor by removing client-side webhook calls
- No changes to user-facing functionality or UI
- All existing features continue to work as expected

**Git Commits:**
- `e0d1eef` - refactor: move webhook calls to server-side API endpoints for security
- `dcb8310` - docs: update CHANGELOG with webhook security refactor
