2. **Airtable Integration** - Automatic storage and retrieval of files with unique profile IDs
3. **API Endpoint** - Secure file upload endpoint with validation

## Critical Fix Applied

**Issue Identified:** The database migration for `airtable_record_id` column was missing from the `initializeDatabase()` function.

**Impact:** File upload feature would fail in production because the database column wouldn't exist.

**Solution:** Added database migration to `lib/db/index.ts`:
```typescript
await sql`ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS airtable_record_id VARCHAR(255)`;
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and deployed (Commit: 1e92c0b)
