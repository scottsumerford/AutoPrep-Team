## Date: October 25, 2025
## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED & BUILT SUCCESSFULLY

---

## What Was Added

### 1. Report Content Download (Text Document Version)
- **AirTable Field**: "Report Content" 
- **Functionality**: Pulls text document version of the report from AirTable
- **User Experience**: Users can now download reports in two formats:
  - **PDF** - Original PDF format (via Report URL)
  - **Text** - Text document version (via Report Content field)

### 2. Failed Report Retry
- **Previous Behavior**: Failed reports showed "Report Failed" message with no action
- **New Behavior**: Failed reports now show "Try again" button
- **Functionality**: Users can click "Try again" to retry report generation
- **Status**: Automatically retries the generation process

### 3. Dual Download Options UI
- When report is completed, users see two download buttons:
  - "Download PDF" (green button with download icon)
  - "Download Text" (blue button with download icon, only if text content available)
- Buttons are displayed side-by-side for easy access

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoint Updates
**File**: `app/api/lindy/presales-report-status/route.ts`

```typescript
// Now returns both PDF URL and Report Content
{
  success: true,
  found: true,
  status: 'completed',
  reportUrl: 'https://example.com/report.pdf',
  reportContent: 'Text version of the report...',
  recordId: 'rec123'
}
```

### State Management
**File**: `app/profile/[slug]/page.tsx`

Added new state variables:
```typescript
const [reportContent, setReportContent] = useState<{ [key: number]: string }>({});
const [slidesContent, setSlidesContent] = useState<{ [key: number]: string }>({});
```

### Polling Effect Update
- Captures `reportContent` from API response
- Stores in state for later download
- Handles both PDF URL and text content

### Button UI Updates

**Completed Report State**:
```jsx
{event.presales_report_status === 'completed' && event.presales_report_url && (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <a href={event.presales_report_url} ...>
      <Download className="w-4 h-4" />
      Download PDF
    </a>
    {reportContent[event.id] && (
      <button onClick={() => { /* download text file */ }}>
        <Download className="w-4 h-4" />
        Download Text
      </button>
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

**Failed Report State**:
```jsx
{event.presales_report_status === 'failed' && (
  <Button onClick={() => handleGeneratePresalesReport(event)}>
    <FileText className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
    Try again
  </Button>
)}
```

### Example AirTable Record
```

## User Experience Flow

### Successful Report Generation
1. User clicks "Generate Pre-Sales Report"
2. Button shows "Generating Report... (20:00)" with countdown timer
3. Frontend polls AirTable every 5 seconds
4. When report is found:
   - Button changes to show two download options
   - "Download PDF" - downloads the PDF file
   - "Download Text" - downloads the text document (if available)

### Failed Report Generation
1. User clicks "Generate Pre-Sales Report"
2. Button shows "Generating Report... (20:00)" with countdown timer
3. After 20 minutes without report:
   - Button shows "Try again"
   - User can click to retry generation
4. If report fails:
   - Button shows "Try again" (red styling)
   - User can click to retry generation
