# File Upload Issue - Complete Analysis & Solution

## Executive Summary

The file upload feature was failing in production due to **two separate issues**:

1. ✅ **FIXED**: Airtable table mismatch (wrong table ID)
2. ⏳ **PENDING**: Missing `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable in Vercel

---

## Issue #1: Airtable Table Mismatch ✅ FIXED

### Problem
The code was configured to use the wrong Airtable table:
- **Configured**: `tbl3xkB7fGkC10CGN` (Meetings table)
- **Expected**: Profiles table (didn't exist)

The Meetings table has fields like "Company Name", "Meeting Date", "Meeting Title", but the file upload code was trying to create records with "Profile ID", "Profile Name", "Profile Email", etc.

### Root Cause
When the Airtable integration was initially set up, it was pointed to the Meetings table instead of creating a dedicated Profiles table for user profile data.

### Solution Implemented ✅
1. **Created new Profiles table in Airtable**
   - Table ID: `tbl2mjvZZG6ExhNbC`
   - Fields: Profile ID, Profile Name, Profile Email, Company Info URL, Slides URL, Created At

2. **Updated code configuration**
   - File: `lib/airtable.ts`
   - Changed: `AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID` from `tbl3xkB7fGkC10CGN` to `tbl2mjvZZG6ExhNbC`
   - Commit: `bd3107f`

3. **Tested thoroughly**
   - ✅ Create profile records
   - ✅ Update profile records
   - ✅ Store base64-encoded files
   - ✅ Delete records

### Status
✅ **DEPLOYED** - This fix is live in production

## Issue #2: Missing Database Connection ⏳ PENDING

### Problem
The file upload API is failing with a 500 error in production because the database connection is not available.

### Root Cause
The `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable is not set in Vercel. The application needs this to connect to the database and retrieve user profiles.

### File Upload Flow (Where It Fails)
```
1. User uploads file
   ↓
2. File sent to /api/files/upload
   ↓
3. File validated ✅
   ↓
4. Profile retrieved from database ❌ FAILS HERE - No database connection
   ↓
5. (Never reaches) Create Airtable record
   ↓
6. (Never reaches) Update Airtable with file URL
```

### Solution Required
Set the `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable in Vercel:

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select "AutoPrep-Team" project
3. Click "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
4. Add new variable:
   - Name: `POSTGRES_URL`
   - Value: `[Your database connection string]`
   - Environments: Production, Preview, Development
5. Save and wait for redeployment (2-5 minutes)

**Finding your database connection string:**
- If using Supabase: Settings → Database → Connection string (URI)
- If using local PostgreSQL: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`

### Status
⏳ **PENDING** - Waiting for you to set environment variables in Vercel

---

## Code Improvements Made

### Enhanced Error Logging
Updated both the file upload API and Airtable functions with comprehensive logging:

**File: `app/api/files/upload/route.ts`**
- Logs each step of the upload process
- Includes detailed error information
- Shows which step failed

**File: `lib/airtable.ts`**
- Logs all Airtable API calls
- Shows request/response details
- Includes error status codes and messages

### Benefits
- When file upload fails, you can check Vercel logs to see exactly where it failed
- Easier debugging for future issues
- Better visibility into the upload process

## Git Commits

### Commit 1: Airtable Table Fix
```
bd3107f - fix: Update Airtable table ID to new Profiles table (tbl2mjvZZG6ExhNbC)
```

### Commit 2: Documentation
```
679735e - docs: Add Airtable file upload fix summary and resolution details
```

### Commit 3: Error Logging
```
9137cf3 - feat: Add comprehensive error logging to file upload and Airtable functions
```

## Testing Results

### Airtable Connectivity ✅
```
✅ Profiles table exists with correct fields
✅ Create records working
✅ Update records working
✅ Delete records working
✅ File URL storage working
```

### Production API ❌
```
❌ Returns 500 error
❌ Database connection failing
⏳ Waiting for POSTGRES_URL environment variable
```

## What You Need to Do

### Immediate Action Required
1. **Set `POSTGRES_URL` in Vercel**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add `POSTGRES_URL` with your database connection string
   - Save and wait for redeployment

2. **Test File Upload**
   - Go to https://team.autoprep.ai
   - Try uploading a file
   - Check if it works

3. **Check Logs if Still Failing**
   - Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Latest → Logs
   - Look for error messages
   - Share the error details

### Optional (Recommended for Security)
Set these environment variables explicitly in Vercel:
- `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`
- `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`
- `AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID`

This removes hardcoded values from the code.

## Expected Outcome After Fix

Once `POSTGRES_URL` is set in Vercel:

1. ✅ File upload API will connect to database
2. ✅ User profile will be retrieved
3. ✅ Airtable record will be created (if needed)
4. ✅ File URL will be stored in both database and Airtable
5. ✅ User will see "Upload successful" message

---

## Troubleshooting

### If file upload still fails after setting POSTGRES_URL:

1. **Check Vercel Logs**
   - Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Latest → Logs
   - Look for detailed error messages
   - Share the error output

2. **Verify Database Connection String**
   - Test the connection string locally first
   - Ensure password is correct
   - Ensure database exists

3. **Check Airtable Configuration**
   - Verify Profiles table exists: `tbl2mjvZZG6ExhNbC`
   - Verify API key is valid
   - Verify table has correct fields

4. **Check Profile Exists**
   - Ensure you have a profile in the database
   - Profile ID should match the one you're trying to upload for
