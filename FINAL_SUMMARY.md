## ⚠️ Current Issue: Profiles Not Persisting

### The Problem
Your profiles are being saved to **in-memory storage** instead of the database because the `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable is not configured in Vercel.

**Evidence:**
```
❌ No POSTGRES_URL found in environment variables
⚠️ No POSTGRES_URL found - using in-memory storage
📦 Database not configured, saving to in-memory storage
```

**Impact:**
- Profiles appear to save successfully
- But they disappear when the server restarts
- Or when you redeploy the application
- This affects the live site: https://team.autoprep.ai

### The Solution
You need to set up a Vercel Postgres database and connect it to your project.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Required for Production)

### Step 1: Set Up Vercel Postgres Database

**Option A: Create New Database (Recommended)**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your "AutoPrep-Team" project
3. Click the **"Storage"** tab
4. Click **"Create Database"** → Select **"Postgres"**
5. Name it: `autoprep-team-db`
6. Select region closest to your users
7. Click **"Create"**
8. Connect it to your "AutoPrep-Team" project
9. Vercel will automatically add `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable

**Option B: Use Existing Database**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/scottsumerford/autoprep-team/settings/environment-variables
2. Click **"Add New"**
3. Key: `POSTGRES_URL`
4. Value: Your connection string (must use pooled connection, port 6543)
5. Select all environments: Production, Preview, Development
6. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Redeploy Application

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/scottsumerford/autoprep-team
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click the three dots (...) on latest deployment
4. Select **"Redeploy"**
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete

### Step 3: Verify It's Working

1. Go to: https://team.autoprep.ai
2. Create a test profile
3. Refresh the page
4. **The profile should still be there!** ✅

### Step 4: Check Vercel Logs

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/scottsumerford/autoprep-team
2. Click latest deployment
3. Click **"View Function Logs"**
4. Look for these success messages:
   ```
   ✅ Database connection string configured: postgres://****@****
   📝 Creating new profile: { name: 'Test User', email: 'test@example.com' }
   💾 Inserting profile into database...
   ✅ Profile created successfully in database: { id: 1, name: 'Test User' }
   ```

## 📊 What's Working Now

- Profile management interface
- Calendar integration UI
- Token tracking UI
- Settings management
- Responsive design
- Dark mode support

### ✅ Code Quality

## 🔍 How to Debug

### Check Local Logs
```bash
cd /home/code/AutoPrep-Team
cat server.log | grep -i "profile\|database"
```

### Check Vercel Logs
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/scottsumerford/autoprep-team
2. Click latest deployment
3. Click "View Function Logs"
4. Look for emoji indicators:
   - ✅ = Success
   - ❌ = Error
   - 📦 = In-memory fallback
   - 💾 = Database operation

### Check Browser Console
1. Go to: https://team.autoprep.ai
2. Press F12
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for API errors or warnings

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **Comprehensive Logging:** Emoji-based logging makes debugging easy
2. **Graceful Fallbacks:** In-memory storage allows development without database
3. **Single Source of Truth:** Consolidated files eliminate confusion
4. **Detailed Documentation:** Step-by-step guides for future reference

### What to Watch Out For
1. **Environment Variables:** Must be set in Vercel for production
2. **Pooled Connections:** Use port 6543, not 5432
3. **Redeployment Required:** Changes to env vars require redeploy
4. **Database Initialization:** Tables auto-create on first API call
