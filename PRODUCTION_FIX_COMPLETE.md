# AutoPrep Team Dashboard - File Upload Issue RESOLVED ✅

**Status:** FIXED & DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Time:** 10:52 PM (America/Chicago)
**Build Status:** ✅ SUCCESSFUL

---

## Executive Summary

The file upload issue in the AutoPrep Team Dashboard has been **completely resolved and deployed to production**. The root cause was an **Airtable date format mismatch combined with missing duplicate prevention logic**. All fixes have been implemented, tested, and deployed.

---

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### Issue 1: Airtable Date Format Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Airtable "Created At" field expects `YYYY-MM-DD` format, but code was sending ISO format
**Solution:** Changed date format in `lib/airtable.ts` line 50
```typescript
// BEFORE: '2025-10-30T02:21:40.000Z' ❌
// AFTER: '2025-10-30' ✅
'Created At': new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
```

### Issue 2: Missing Duplicate Prevention ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Code attempted to create new Airtable records without checking if they already existed
**Solution:** Added `findProfileInAirtableByEmail()` function to search for existing records
```typescript
// Search Airtable for existing profile by email
const existingRecordId = await findProfileInAirtableByEmail(profileEmail);
if (existingRecordId) {
  return existingRecordId; // Use existing record
}
// Only create new record if one doesn't exist
```

### Issue 3: Database Sync Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Production database didn't have `airtable_record_id` set for profiles
**Solution:** Created sync endpoint and updated database with correct record IDs
```
Endpoint: POST /api/db/fix-airtable-ids
Updates: profile.airtable_record_id = 'recq4zQfWclBVJUve'
```

### Issue 4: TypeScript Errors ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Type casting issues and duplicate properties in code
**Solution:** Properly typed error responses and removed duplicate properties

## How File Upload Works Now

```
User uploads file
    ↓
API validates file (type, size)
    ↓
Database retrieves profile
    ↓
Check if profile has airtable_record_id
    ├─ YES → Use existing record ID
    └─ NO → Search Airtable for existing record by email
       ├─ FOUND → Use existing record ID
       └─ NOT FOUND → Create new record
    ↓
File converted to base64
    ↓
Update Airtable record with file URLs ✅ (CORRECT DATE FORMAT)
    ↓
Update database with file URLs
    ↓
Return success response
```

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

### First File Upload
1. ✅ Code searches Airtable for existing profile by email
2. ✅ Finds existing record: `recq4zQfWclBVJUve`
3. ✅ Uses existing record instead of creating duplicate
4. ✅ Updates database with airtable_record_id
5. ✅ Uploads file successfully
6. ✅ **No more "Airtable error" message**

### Subsequent File Uploads
1. ✅ Database already has airtable_record_id
2. ✅ Skips Airtable search
3. ✅ Uses existing record directly
4. ✅ Faster upload process
