# AutoPrep Calendar Sync Fix - Session Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Time:** 10:15 PM (America/Chicago)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Code fixes complete - Awaiting production database configuration

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Profile Page Refresh After OAuth (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
**Issue:** After OAuth callback, profile page didn't refresh to show "‚úì Connected" status  
**Fix:** Added `useSearchParams()` hook to detect `?synced=true` parameter and trigger profile refresh  
**File:** `app/profile/[slug]/page.tsx`  
**Commit:** `3a6d2c5`

```typescript
const synced = searchParams.get('synced');

useEffect(() => {
  if (synced === 'true' && profile) {
    console.log('üîÑ Refreshing profile after OAuth sync...');
    fetchProfile();
  }
}, [synced, profile, fetchProfile]);
```

**Result:** Profile now shows green "‚úì Connected" status immediately after OAuth

## What Still Needs to Be Fixed

### 2. Calendar Events Not Persisting (‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES YOUR ACTION)
**Issue:** Calendar events disappear after page refresh  
**Root Cause:** `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable not configured in Vercel  
**Impact:** Events saved to in-memory storage instead of database

**What You Need to Do:**

1. **Get Supabase Connection String**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Click "Project Settings" ‚Üí "Database"
   - Find "Connection Pooling" section
   - Copy the "Transaction" mode connection string (port 6543)
   - Format: `postgresql://[user]:[password]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`

2. **Set POSTGRES_URL in Vercel**
   - Go to [Vercel Project Settings](https://vercel.com/scottsumerford/autoprep-team/settings/environment-variables)
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Create/update `POSTGRES_URL` with the connection string
   - Apply to: Production, Preview, Development
   - Save and trigger deployment

3. **Test Calendar Sync**
   - Visit https://team.autoprep.ai/profile/north-texas-shutters
   - Click "Connect Google" or "Connect Outlook"
   - Complete OAuth flow
   - Verify events appear
   - **Refresh page** - events should still appear ‚úÖ
