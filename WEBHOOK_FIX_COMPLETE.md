# Webhook Configuration Fix - Complete Summary

## Date: October 22, 2025
## Status: ✅ FIXED AND DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION

---

## Problem Identified

When testing the pre-sales report generation for the "new test for autoprep" event on the North Texas Shutters profile, the system returned:

**Error: "Failed to start report generation: Pre-sales webhook URL not configured"**

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was that the Lindy webhook configuration was missing from the production environment:

1. **Local .env file** had the webhook URLs and secrets
2. **Vercel production environment** did NOT have these variables set
3. The code was checking for these environment variables but they weren't available in production

---

## Solution Implemented

### Step 1: Updated Code to Use Environment Variables ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/lindy/presales-report/route.ts`
- `app/api/lindy/slides/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Changed from hardcoded webhook URLs to environment variables
- Added validation to check if webhook URL and secret are configured
- Added proper error messages if configuration is missing

### Step 2: Added Environment Variables to .env ✅

**Local .env file updated with:**
```
LINDY_PRESALES_WEBHOOK_URL=https://public.lindy.ai/api/v1/webhooks/lindy/b149f3a8-2679-4d0b-b4ba-7dfb5f399eaa
LINDY_PRESALES_WEBHOOK_SECRET=2d32c0eab49ac81fad1578ab738e6a9ab2d811691c4afb8947928a90e6504f07
LINDY_SLIDES_WEBHOOK_URL=https://public.lindy.ai/api/v1/webhooks/lindy/66bf87f2-034e-463b-a7da-83e9adbf03d4
LINDY_SLIDES_WEBHOOK_SECRET=f395b62647c72da770de97f7715ee68824864b21b9a2435bdaab7004762359c5
```

### Step 3: Committed and Pushed Code Changes ✅

**Commit:** `15eab55`
**Message:** "fix: Add missing Lindy webhook configuration and use environment variables"

### Step 4: Added Environment Variables to Vercel Production ✅

**Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables**

Added all 4 environment variables:
- ✅ LINDY_PRESALES_WEBHOOK_URL
- ✅ LINDY_PRESALES_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- ✅ LINDY_SLIDES_WEBHOOK_URL
- ✅ LINDY_SLIDES_WEBHOOK_SECRET
