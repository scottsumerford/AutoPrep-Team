# Version 1.0 Reference Files

## Overview

This folder contains all Version 1.0 reference documentation and historical files from the AutoPrep system's initial development phase. These files serve as a comprehensive archive of the system's evolution and design decisions.

## Purpose

These markdown files document:
- Initial system architecture and design
- Development progress and milestones
- Bug fixes and issue resolutions
- Deployment procedures and configurations
- Agent setup and integration guides
- Testing summaries and verification checklists
- Production deployment records

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Historical Reference Only**: These files represent Version 1.0 of the AutoPrep system and are maintained for historical reference and context. They should not be modified to preserve the integrity of the development record.

## Version 2.0 Development

The current Version 2.0 development code is located in the root directory of this repository:
- `/app` - Application code
- `/components` - React components
- `/lib` - Utility libraries
- `/public` - Static assets
- `package.json` - Project dependencies

## File Organization

All 87 Version 1.0 markdown files have been organized in this folder to maintain a clear separation between:
- **V1 Reference** (this folder) - Historical documentation
- **V2 Development** (root directory) - Current active codebase

This separation ensures that the development environment remains clean and focused on Version 2.0 while preserving complete historical documentation.
