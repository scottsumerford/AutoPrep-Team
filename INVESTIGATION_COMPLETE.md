# File Upload Issue - Investigation Complete ✅

**Status:** Investigation Complete - Root Cause Identified & Fixed
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Investigator:** AutoPrep App Developer

---

## Executive Summary

The file upload failures in the AutoPrep Team Dashboard have been **identified and fixed**. The root cause was an **Airtable date format mismatch** where the API was sending ISO format timestamps instead of the required `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

### Key Findings:
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified:** Airtable "Created At" field expects `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- ✅ **Fix Deployed:** Code updated to use correct date format
- ✅ **All Systems Verified:** Database, Airtable API, file validation all working
- ✅ **Production Ready:** All changes committed and pushed to main branch

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The Airtable API was rejecting file uploads with the error:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "INVALID_VALUE_FOR_COLUMN",
    "message": "Field \"Created At\" cannot accept the provided value"
  }
}
```

### Why It Happened
In `lib/airtable.ts` line 50, the code was sending:
```typescript
'Created At': new Date().toISOString()  // ❌ Sends: 2025-10-30T02:21:40.000Z
```

But Airtable's date field requires:
```typescript
'Created At': new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]  // ✅ Sends: 2025-10-30
```

### Evidence
- **Local Testing:** Confirmed ISO format fails, YYYY-MM-DD format succeeds
- **Airtable Documentation:** Date fields require `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- **API Response:** Error message explicitly states invalid value for "Created At" field

---

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes

**File: `lib/airtable.ts` (Line 50)**
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
'Created At': new Date().toISOString(),

// AFTER (FIXED)
'Created At': new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
```

**Commit:** `13daa63` - "fix: Use correct date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for Airtable Created At field"

### Additional Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling** (Commit `7592634`)
   - Added detailed error messages for each step of the upload process
   - Separate error handling for database, file reading, and Airtable operations
   - Better error context for debugging

2. **Improved Logging** (Commit `9137cf3`)
   - Comprehensive logging at each step of the file upload process
   - Detailed Airtable API logging
   - Better visibility into what's happening during uploads

3. **Response Simplification** (Commit `4889425`)
   - Simplified error response structure
   - Consistent error message format

## System Verification

### ✅ Verified Working Components

1. **Database Connection**
   - POSTGRES_URL configured in Vercel
   - All 6 test profiles created successfully
   - Profile retrieval working correctly

2. **Airtable API**
   - Successfully creates records with correct date format
   - Airtable credentials verified
   - Table ID confirmed: `tbl2mjvZZG6ExhNbC`

3. **File Validation**
   - Accepts all required file types: PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX, TXT, CSV
   - File size validation working (50MB limit)
   - Base64 encoding working correctly

4. **Profile Management**
   - Scott Sumerford profile created (ID: 1)
   - All profile fields accessible
   - Airtable record ID tracking working

```

### Environment Configuration

**Production (Vercel):**
- POSTGRES_URL: ✅ Set
- AIRTABLE_API_KEY: ✅ Set
- AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID: ✅ Set (tbl2mjvZZG6ExhNbC)

## File Upload Process Flow

The complete file upload process now works as follows:

```
1. User uploads file via FileUploadSection
   ↓
2. API validates file (type, size)
   ↓
3. Database retrieves profile (Scott Sumerford, ID: 1)
   ↓
4. File converted to base64 data URL
   ↓
5. Airtable record created with YYYY-MM-DD date ✅ FIXED
   ↓
6. Database updated with file URL
   ↓
7. Airtable record updated with file URLs
   ↓
8. Success response returned to client
```
